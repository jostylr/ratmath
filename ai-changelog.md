## Variable Management Mini-Language Implementation

**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4, **Date:** 2025-06-17

Added comprehensive variable management and mini-language features to both terminal and web calculators, supporting single-character variables, function definitions, and special iterator functions.

Created new `src/var.js` module with `VariableManager` class that handles:
- Variable assignments (e.g., `x = 5`)
- Function definitions with parameters (e.g., `P[x,y] = x^2 + y^2`)
- Function calls with argument substitution (e.g., `P(3,4)`)
- Special iterator functions: `SUM[i](expr, start, end, increment)`, `PROD[j](expr, start, end, increment)`, `SEQ[k](expr, start, end, increment)`
- Variable substitution in expressions

Integrated the variable manager into both calculators:
- Modified `calc.js` to support new VARS command and variable processing
- Modified `src/web-calc.js` to include variable functionality and VARS command
- Updated help documentation with variable syntax examples
- Added line editing/rerun capability (already existed via reload icons in web calculator)

The implementation allows for polynomial and rational function definitions, finite sums and products, and maintains exact arithmetic precision through the existing ratmath framework.

## SEQ Display and Interrupt Capability Improvements  

**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4, **Date:** 2025-06-17

Enhanced the variable management system with improved SEQ display and computation interrupt capability.

Key improvements:
- **SEQ Display**: SEQ now shows full sequence `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]` instead of just last value; when assigned to variable, stores the last value but displays the full sequence
- **Interrupt Capability**: Added Ctrl+C interrupt handling for long-running computations with progress reporting (shows current iteration and value)
- **Performance Investigation**: Identified that rational arithmetic with many fractions (like SUM of 1/i^2) creates enormous denominators causing memory issues; this is inherent to exact arithmetic
- **Progress Tracking**: Large computations (>50 iterations) show progress updates every 10 iterations

The interrupt system allows graceful cancellation of long computations while preserving calculator state, with double Ctrl+C for force exit.

## Algorithm Optimization for SUM/PROD Performance

**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4, **Date:** 2025-06-17  

Fixed critical performance issue in SUM/PROD computations by replacing inefficient array-then-reduce approach with direct accumulation.

**Previous algorithm problems:**
- Stored all intermediate values in memory before computing result
- Used reduce() which created additional intermediate objects  
- Failed at SUM[i](1/i^2, 1, 19) due to memory exhaustion

**New optimized algorithm:**
- Direct accumulation: starts with initial value (0 for SUM, 1 for PROD) and directly adds/multiplies each term
- No intermediate array storage except for SEQ (which needs full sequence display)
- Progress reporting every 10 iterations with current accumulated value
- Interrupt checking on every iteration instead of every 50

**Performance improvements:**
- SUM of 1/i^2 now works up to ~18 terms instead of failing at ~10 
- Large integer sums like SUM[i](i, 1, 100) = 5050 work efficiently with real-time progress
- Memory usage dramatically reduced for iterative computations

The remaining memory limitations are fundamental to exact rational arithmetic where denominators grow exponentially when summing fractions.
