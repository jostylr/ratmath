# JSON Serialization Implementation TODO

## Overview
Add comprehensive JSON import/export functionality to RatMath for preserving exact rational arithmetic state, enabling data interchange, educational content sharing, and session management while maintaining mathematical precision.

## Core Serialization Framework

### 1. Base Serialization Interface

#### Universal JSON Methods
- [ ] Add `toJSON()` method to all number classes (Rational, Integer, RationalInterval, etc.)
- [ ] Add static `fromJSON(obj)` method to all number classes
- [ ] Implement consistent serialization format across all types
- [ ] Version stamping for forward/backward compatibility
- [ ] Validation of JSON structure during deserialization

#### Serialization Format Design
- [ ] Standardized format with type identification:
  ```javascript
  {
    "type": "Rational",
    "version": "1.0",
    "numerator": "22",
    "denominator": "7"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Use string representation for BigInt values to avoid precision loss
- [ ] Include metadata for complex objects (intervals, fractions, etc.)
- [ ] Nested serialization for compound objects
- [ ] Error recovery for malformed JSON

#### Global Utilities
- [ ] `RatMath.replacer` function for JSON.stringify
- [ ] `RatMath.reviver` function for JSON.parse  
- [ ] `RatMath.serialize(obj)` - comprehensive object serialization
