# Continued Fractions Implementation TODO

## Overview
Add continued fraction support to RatMath library using the syntax `3.~7~15~1~292` for representing rational numbers as continued fractions. While support for repeaing patterns using `#`, this leads to irrational numbers and will not be implemented in this library.

## Core Implementation

### 1. Parser Extension
- [x] Extend parser to recognize `.~` pattern in expressions
- [x] Add tokenization for `~` separator in continued fraction context
- [x] Add validation for continued fraction format
- [x] The stand-alone parsing should generate an array of the coefficients with the first entry being the integer part, which can be 0.
- [x] Intgerating into calc.js, the parsing of this pattern should then tatke the array and feed it into the Rational class method of .fromContinuedFraction that returns a rational

### 2. ContinuedFraction Class
  There is no ContinuedFraction Class. For this library, continued fraction is just an input or output format and does not represent a different underlying object.
- [x] Augment instances with a cf property which is the array without the integer part. The integer part is instead put in the already existing wholePart if not already defined and isNegative is also handled if processing a cf conversion.
- [x] Also support having an array of convergents on the instance, called convergents.

### 3. Conversion Methods

#### From Continued Fraction to Rational
- [x] The Rational class should have the method `fromContinuedFraction` which takes in an array whose first entry can be any integer and all successive entries are positive integers.
- [x] Algorithm to compute convergents using recurrence relation:
  - p₋₁ = 1, p₀ = a₀, pₙ = aₙ * pₙ₋₁ + pₙ₋₂
  - q₋₁ = 0, q₀ = 1, qₙ = aₙ * qₙ₋₁ + qₙ₋₂

#### From Rational to Continued Fraction
- [x] `toContinuedFraction()` method on Rational class
- [x] Euclidean algorithm implementation for extracting coefficients
- [x] Optional parameter of `maxTerms` - limit number of terms for display
- [x] Set a default limit on the number of terms to generate on the Rational class. Say 1000.
- [x] This should return an array with the leading entry as the whole part. Also, it should save it on the instance; the first entry is the whole part.
- [x] The last term should not be 1 (unless representing the integer 1 and the last term is the first term).

### 4. String Representation
- [x] `toString()` method on ContinuedFraction class using `3.~7~15~1~292` format
- [x] `fromString()` static method to parse continued fraction strings
- [x] If the leading integer is 0, do include it.
- [x] If it is an integer, say 3, then write the verbose form of `3.~0`. Ensure the parser can parse that correctly, recognizing that the last 0 should not be added to the array.

## Advanced Features

### 5. Convergents Support
- [x] `convergents()` instance method on Rational.js to give an array of convergents; if the first argument is an integer, return up to that number of convergents. Otherwise return up to the limit on the Class.
- [x] Also have a static method on Ration.js that accepts continued fraction string or an array of continued fraction coefficeints and optional number of convergents desired (default is up to max on Rational class)
- [x] Return array of Rational objects representing successive approximations
- [x] Efficient computation using recurrence relations

### 6. Utility Methods
- [x] `getConvergent(n)` - get nth convergent as Rational
- [x] `approximationError(target)` - compute error of convergents vs target value
- [x] `bestApproximation(maxDenominator)` - find best rational approximation within denominator limit

### 7. Farey Sequence and Mediant Inverse Operations
- [x] `fareyParents()` method on Fraction class
  - Find unique Farey neighbors [a/b, c/d] where the given Fraction is their mediant; extend the Farey notion to also be in other intervals than [0,1]. For integers, this will involve one of the infinite fractions.
  - Use Stern-Brocot tree structure for proper Farey neighbor identification
  - Return `{left: Fraction, right: Fraction}` representing parent interval
  - ✅ **Fixed: Now uses correct tree navigation producing determinant ±1**
- [x] `mediantPartner(endpoint, mediant)` static method on Fraction class
  - Given one endpoint and the mediant, compute the other endpoint
  - Solve mediant equation: mediant = (a+c)/(b+d)
  - Return the missing endpoint as Fraction
- [x] `isMediantTriple(left, mediant, right)` static method on Fraction class
  - Verify that mediant is actually the mediant of left and right
  - Return boolean validation result
- [x] `isFareyTriple(left, mediant, right)` static method on Fraction class that does the same as mediant triple but also verifies that the left and right are neighbors in the Farey sequence (|ad - bc|=1)
- [x] Integration with existing mediant operations
  - Connect to existing `mediant()` method in Fraction class
  - Ensure consistency with FractionInterval mediant operations
  - Add validation to existing mediant calculations



### 8. Stern-Brocot Tree Support in Fraction Class
- [x] Extend Fraction class to allow infinite fractions for tree boundaries
  - Allow `new Fraction(1, 0)` to represent positive infinity (right boundary)
  - Allow `new Fraction(-1, 0)` to represent negative infinity (left boundary)
  - These are essential for Stern-Brocot tree root: mediants of 0/1 and 1/0
  - Update validation to permit zero denominators only for ±1/0 cases
  - Ensure arithmetic operations handle infinite fractions appropriately
- [x] Stern-Brocot tree navigation methods on Fraction class
  - `sternBrocotParent()` - find parent node in the tree
  - `sternBrocotChildren()` - find left and right child nodes
  - `sternBrocotPath()` - return path from root as array of 'L'/'R' directions
  - `fromSternBrocotPath(path)` - construct fraction from L/R path string
- [x] Tree validation and utilities
  - `isSternBrocotValid()` - verify fraction exists in canonical tree position
  - `sternBrocotDepth()` - calculate depth/level in the tree
  - `sternBrocotAncestors()` - return array of all ancestors up to root
  - ✅ **Fixed: Ancestors now properly ordered ending with root 1/1**

### 9. Integration with Existing Classes
- [x] Update Parser to handle continued fraction expressions in arithmetic
- [x] Add continued fraction support to template functions (R, F)
- [x] Ensure continued fractions work in interval arithmetic contexts
- [x] Add continued fraction examples to existing test suites

## Implementation Notes

### Mathematical Considerations
- Continued fractions for rationals are always finite
- Convergents provide best rational approximations
- Even convergents approach from below, odd from above
- Last convergent of finite CF equals the original rational exactly

### Performance Considerations
- Use BigInt arithmetic for large coefficients
- Implement efficient convergent computation
- Handle very long continued fractions gracefully

### Error Handling
- Validate continued fraction coefficients (positive integers except a₀)
- Handle division by zero in convergent computation
- Provide clear error messages for invalid CF syntax
- Graceful degradation for infinite/periodic patterns

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Quadratic irrational support (√2, φ, etc.) - belongs in separate library
- Infinite continued fractions for transcendental numbers
- Specialized algorithms for specific mathematical constants
- Advanced number theory applications

## Priority
1. **High**: Parser extension, basic CF class, conversion methods
2. **Medium**: String representation, convergents, integration
3. **Low**: Advanced utilities, performance optimization, extended documentation
