# Document Processing with RatMath TODO

## Overview
A separate document processing project that imports RatMath as a library to create a powerful system for generating mathematical documents with embedded exact calculations. This would be similar to literate programming tools like Jupyter notebooks but focused on mathematical document generation with LaTeX output.

## Project Architecture

### 1. Separate Project Structure
- [ ] Create new project: `ratmath-docs` or `ratmath-literate`
- [ ] Import RatMath as dependency: `import { Rational, Parser, ... } from 'ratmath'`
- [ ] Modular architecture for different input/output formats
- [ ] Plugin system for extensibility
- [ ] CLI tool and programmatic API

### 2. Input Format Design

#### Template Syntax Options
- [ ] **Double Brace Syntax**: `{{1/3 + 1/4}}` for inline calculations
- [ ] **Code Block Syntax**: Markdown-style code blocks with `ratmath` language
- [ ] **Directive Syntax**: Custom directives like `@calc{1/3 + 1/4}`
- [ ] **Mixed Approach**: Support multiple syntaxes for different use cases

#### Document Structure
```markdown
# Fraction Addition Problems

## Problem 1
Calculate: {{1/3}} + {{1/4}} = {{1/3 + 1/4}}

## Problem 2 
```ratmath
let numerator1 = 2
let denominator1 = 5
let numerator2 = 3  
let denominator2 = 7
let fraction1 = numerator1/denominator1
let fraction2 = numerator2/denominator2
let sum = fraction1 + fraction2
```

The sum of {{fraction1}} and {{fraction2}} is {{sum}}.

Result: ${{sum|latex:academic}}$
```

- denominator2: random(2, 8)

## Problem
Add {{numerator1}}/{{denominator1}} + {{numerator2}}/{{denominator2}}

## Solution
